## Project Overview

**Galactic Explorers** is an immersive space exploration game where users can join guilds, explore planets, buy and sell items in the marketplace, participate in challenges, and manage inventories. This API supports all of these features using a modular and scalable architecture. The backend is built with **Node.js**, using **Express** for API routing, **MySQL** for database management, and **Nodemon** for automatic server restarting during development.

The project follows **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) architecture to maintain clean code organization. Routes handle HTTP requests, controllers manage business logic, and models interact with the database.
